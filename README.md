# Customer-Insights
This repository contains a data analysis project that focuses on customer insight and segmentation for a retail dataset. The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior, perform customer segmentation using various clustering algorithms, and conduct market basket analysis to uncover patterns in customers' purchasing habits.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains retail transaction data, including information such as customer ID, invoice date, product description, quantity, unit price, and revenue. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer transactions and enables various analyses to understand customer behavior.

## Analysis Steps

The data analysis includes the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset is explored using various statistical techniques and visualizations to understand the data distribution, identify outliers, and gain initial insights into customer behavior.

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.

3. Customer Segmentation: Several clustering algorithms, including BIRCH, DBSCAN, and K-means, are applied to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and behaviors. This helps identify distinct customer groups with similar characteristics.

4. Market Basket Analysis: Association rules mining techniques, are utilized to uncover patterns in customers' purchasing habits. This analysis helps identify frequently co-occurring products and enables targeted cross-selling or upselling strategies.

5. Visualization: Visualizations such as bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and network graphs are created to present the findings from the data analysis. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of customer segments, associations between products, and other valuable insights.

6. Interpretation and Recommendations: The analysis results are interpreted to extract meaningful insights into customer behavior, identify key customer segments, and provide actionable recommendations for marketing strategies, personalized campaigns, and customer retention initiatives.
